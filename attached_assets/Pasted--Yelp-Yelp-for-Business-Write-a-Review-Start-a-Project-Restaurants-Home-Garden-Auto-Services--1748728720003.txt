What are people saying about bakeries in Seattle, WA?

This is a review for bakeries in Seattle, WA:

"This is the bakery of my dreams! They have everything I love, from cakes, croissants, sandwiches, macarons, and other amazing pastries. I got the chocolate croissant and an almond croissant, and it was so flaky and delicious. The fillings are not too strong and not too sweet. We also got the sandwiches, the Italian roll is my favorite which has salami and provolone. They also have baguettes, all the delicious cakes such as chocolate, tiramisu, and seasonal cakes such as raspberry spring cake, and lemon spring cake. I also ordered their vanilla latte and it was delicious. This place reminds me of the bakeries in New York, fresh ingredients, so many options. Highly recommend!"
